# BME280
 This sketch uses SDA/SCL on the Ladybug development board.
 The BME280 is a simple but high resolution pressure/humidity/temperature sensor, which can be used in its high resolution
 mode but with power consumption of 20 microAmp, or in a lower resolution mode with power consumption of
 only 1 microAmp. The choice will depend on the application.
